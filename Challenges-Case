Situation 1: We want to know the total number of movies we have in the R, PG-13, and PG categories. 


Solution:

SELECT 
	SUM (CASE
               WHEN rating = 'R' THEN 1
	       ELSE 0
	      END
	) AS "R",
	
	SUM (CASE
               WHEN rating = 'PG-13' THEN 1
	       ELSE 0
	      END
	) AS "PG-13",
	
	SUM (CASE
               WHEN rating = 'PG' THEN 1
	       ELSE 0
	      END
	) AS "PG"
